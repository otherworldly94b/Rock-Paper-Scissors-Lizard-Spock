### Content
- Code was taken and inspired from the [Love Running](https://github.com/otherworldly94b/love-running) project for a lot of this current project.
- The biggest similarities should be in social media links, the "times" section and the Gallery page.
- The signup page should also have similarities but the code for it was written by me in the Love Running project as well.
- Some CSS code was also inspired from the [Love Running](https://github.com/otherworldly94b/love-running) project.

### Media
